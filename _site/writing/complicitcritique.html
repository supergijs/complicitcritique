<h1 id="complicit-critique">Complicit Critique</h1>

<p>I can’t say I did not have a sense of the group I was going to teach. As a coordinator I watched them in their first year, growing their critical teeth. No figure, not even Victor Papanek, was safe. I remember how one day after the class received an assignment from the UN and the Netherlands Food Partnership, there already was an open letter dicing the brief. This was a Critical Inquiry Lab cohort that wasn’t shy of living up to its first name.</p>

<p>One issue I have with critique is how seductive it can be. Not just the position of being able to judge, but also the moral relief; an almost automatic disassociation from whatever I may disapprove of. Calling something ‘bad’ makes me feel ‘good.’ High up in the tower, I’m all by myself. In a school that approaches design as a form of cultural critique: what does it mean to have critique as the basis of a practice?</p>

<p>There was a poster in the elevator: “Who can afford to be critical?”</p>

<p>The possibility of losing the towering judge-perspective may actually be very close by. Just point your critical gaze inwards and you may find the characteristics that you scrutinise your villain for. In the first Ego Design workshop, I learned that it wasn’t hard for the group to recognise the ‘counterdesire’ they’re up against in their projects (and life). Everyone has inner dragons.</p>

<p>But what happens to criticality? Recognising the urge of your villain in your own body disqualifies a mode of critique based on an impartial perspective. No ingredient remains pure in a stew. Would too much tenderness not blunt your teeth?  How can you still be critical if you are complicit?</p>

<p>I saw a meme: “I went to DAE  and all I got was an attitude.”</p>

<p>I think that what I enjoy about teaching, and teaching this group in particular, is how they showed me different attitudes. Ways of relating otherwise, to the powers that be, to powers that aren’t, bodies around, bodies hidden. Ways of relating open up different roles to play, ways of responding to a context. Or as they themselves have come to call them: archetypes. Let me now, based on some ‘future designer’ archetypes the group articulated in the second Ego Trends workshop, give you a taste of complicit critique.</p>

<p>First, as an accomplice, you can start by looking at yourself. Most inspiring to the Introspectator archetype is “discovering a connection between my deep feelings and the bigger system imposed upon me.” You may, for instance, realise that pure objectivity is a myth. Yet its seduction will not disappear. Matilde Brizzi shares her inner negotiations of making peace with it, offering a glimpse of a relation with objectivity.</p>

<p>If you’re complicit, you feel very well that things are more complex than they seem. The Intricator punctures the appearance of simplicity to recognise the knotted arrangements it rests on. Oshin Siao Bhatt resists the idea that medical technologies would make care work redundant, because she knows that scientific processes, like her ‘academic’ writing, only exist as a product of care. “Dangerous as sand in a gearbox.”</p>

<p>Over here, modern tools and narratives fall short in offering an appropriate attitude. “The Fortune-telling Archivist reads past ways of knowing and weaves them into constellations that expand the imagination in unforeseen ways.” Old myths can help make sense in a messy situation. Camille Wiesel listens to Narcissus to navigate the waters of self-formation online. Meanwhile, witchcraft whispers to Lina von Jaruntowski, offering ways to recognise the weather as an entity who talks back.</p>

<p>Without the option to retreat to a clean office to design a solution, what can you do? The mantra of the Swimmer: “be porous.” Franziska Bax found herself knowing that we are inseparable from nature, but not feeling that we are. So she swam through compound concepts and tweaked sounds until a feeling of entanglement resonated in the room.</p>

<p>Together with the rest of this cohort, these graduates have shown me how simmering in complicity slowly transforms critique: from conviction, through experience, to ways of relating to circumstances (including design), until tender.</p>
