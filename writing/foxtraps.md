# Between Fox Traps and Hero Bait
#### An essay on what design discourse can learn from the poetics of emerging types of memes.

###### Meme by @ethicaldesign69.

A square image, listing 46 titles of design genres, set in Times New Roman, roughly ordered in two columns, on top of a highly saturated image of a sitting fox. Some genres seem to be added later, squeezed in to maintain the alphabetical order. The sitting “Stoned Fox” is a meme often used to signal unease, but it is *deep-fried*: it looks like it has been through many iterations of compression that come with online re-sharing. The meme author @ethicaldesign69 seems to express a discomfort with these design genres, deep-frying the image as if their unease has grown more extreme with each added genre.

I like the idea of design discourse as a place for designers and critics to come together – in symposia, schools, and magazines – to figure out roles for designers that are more helpful than harmful for this world. When that balance feels off, design discourse can respond by analysing what is wrong and proposing ways of doing otherwise. But what if something in design discourse itself starts to feel off? The meme distils a lingering discomfort that I recognise. Even though I like it that there are so many attempts at finding new roles, I notice that I’ve grown suspicious. Seeing the genres all together makes me cringe. They feel pretentious, more like studio start-ups than explorative attempts.

#### Hero bait

In a series of tweets from March 2022, @ethicaldesign69 argues that this is a result of market pressures. “Design discourse itself has been commodified,” they wrote, “causing an academic overproduction of design genres that all promise emancipation one way or another, but eventually just perpetuate a ‘false consciousness’ by assuming that designers had the agency to resist the logic of a capitalist economy within the scope of their individual careers.” In other words, the inflated claims of design discourse about designers conquering capital, could ironically be themselves a product of market pressure.

It seems like a plausible explanation, if we look at the claims from current design writers that @ethicaldesign69 often quotes in their memes: “design can transcend the logics, structures, and subjectivities of capitalism,” (Matthew Wizinsky); “how capitalism took hold of graphic design, and how to escape from it,” (Ruben Pater); and “designers can take hold of, dismantle, and rewire some of the abusive structures of capital,” (Keller Easterling). These quotes are all from promotional texts, respectively a publisher’s summary, book cover, and interview. Even though the promoted books will likely be more nuanced, the claims are reduced to a power promise, filtered from any limits or doubts. Let’s call it hero bait: invitations for the role of a saviour, carefully crafted for a designer who feels stuck at their desk doing non-meaningful work.

A salesperson undertone is hard to unhear every time a writer proposes another design genre. Like a food market, this marketplace of ideas can become an arena of voices, all in competition for designer attention through bluff, exaggerated differentiation, and seductive offers. It is as if design has become a victim of its own power: making things appear nice, strong, and seductive has set its genres up to fall short. But with so much emphasis on promises, where does critique go?

@ethicaldesign69 fits within a wider wave of memepages that are critical of their respective creative disciplines, including @dank.lloyd.wright in architecture, @freeze_magazine in art, and @bluefoamdust in industrial and interaction design. These pages attract me because they voice a critique that is less present in other discursive spaces. While “mainstream” design discourse – that which is backed institutionally through systems such as book deals, teaching or curatorial positions and speaker fees – can seem to be under pressure to “promise emancipation,” it is in these memes that lingering suspicions about those very promises find their home. In this respect, I read @ethicaldesign69 as marginalised design discourse.

With such a split, will discourse still function well? Can it still be that place where hopes and suspicions, proposals and critiques, are measured against practice? If in mainstream discourse the currency is hope, any critique or humble genre would need to be transformed into a power promise to be heard.

Yet perhaps hope is not that necessary for attention. Design memes, for one, certainly get attention without offering hope. Is there a way to tempt the hero with another kind of call to adventure: not with the power of the elixir, but with a mission, a map, or a gang? With a journey of exploration ahead that may challenge and transform them. In design discourse, how to attract designers for the adventure of exploring a position that is still unresolved?
